### Approach & Analysis

When initially analyzing the queries, I looked at the provided graphs of the path distribution, query distribution, and query frequency. From there, I initally tried to figure out how to use all of this data to find how I should connect the graph and weight the edges. The key thing I should've noted was that some nodes were never targeted. Further, I eventually decided to plot the distrubtion of which nodes were targeted that led to how I could simplify my approach greatly.

### Optimization Strategy

The optimization strategy focused on two main aspects. First, I aimed to create a highly connected subgraph among the nodes that were actually targeted, which i found to be nodes <45. These nodes were identified based on their frequency in successful queries. By ensuring these nodes were well-connected, I aimed to improve the success rate of queries and reduce the average path length for successful queries.

### Implementation Details

The implementation involved several key steps. Initially, I used a Counter to track the frequency of each target node in successful queries. This allowed me to identify the most frequently targeted nodes, which I then sorted to determine the primary candidates. However, upon further observation of the results data, I realized that a simpler approach could be just as effective.

Instead of relying on the Counter, I focused on nodes with IDs less than 45, as these were consistently the most relevant in the query results. This observation allowed me to directly select the primary candidates without the need for detailed frequency analysis.

Next, I created a copy of the initial graph to modify. For the targeted nodes, I established a cycle of connections to ensure they were highly interconnected. This was achieved by iterating through the list of targeted nodes and connecting each node to the next, with the last node wrapping around to connect to the first node.

For nodes outside the targeted set, I provided minimal connectivity by connecting each of these nodes to the first targeted node. This ensured that all nodes remained reachable while keeping the number of edges within the specified constraints.

Finally, I verified that the optimized graph met the constraints on the maximum number of edges and edges per node. This step was crucial to ensure that the optimization was valid and would be accepted by the evaluation script. I also planned to experiment more with the weights of the edges but realized I had hit the 2-hour mark, as I didn't decide on the simpler approach until later on.

### Results

The optimized graph showed significant improvements in query performance. Here are the detailed results:

Success Rate:

Initial: 79.5% (159/200)
Optimized: 100.0% (200/200)
Improvement: 20.5%
Path Lengths (successful queries only):

Initial: 543.5 (159/200 queries)
Optimized: 7.0 (200/200 queries)
Improvement: 98.7%
Combined Score (success rate Ã— path efficiency):

Score: 536.49
These results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both the success rate and the efficiency of query paths, highlighting the effectiveness of the optimized graph.

### Trade-offs & Limitations

While the optimization strategy significantly improved query performance, there were some trade-offs and limitations to consider. The approach focused on simplicity by directly connecting the most frequently targeted nodes and providing minimal connectivity for other nodes. This simplicity might not capture all the nuances of the query patterns, potentially overlooking some beneficial connections.

The choice of using nodes with IDs less than 45 as primary candidates was based on observations from the results data. This threshold might not be universally applicable and could impact the effectiveness of the optimization if the query patterns change or if applied to different datasets.

While the initial implementation included plans to experiment with edge weights, time constraints limited the ability to fully explore this aspect. Further adjustments to edge weights could potentially enhance the performance even more.

The approach was tailored to the specific dataset and query patterns observed. For larger graphs or different query patterns, the strategy might need adjustments to maintain its effectiveness.

Finally, the optimization was based on specific observations from the provided results data. As such, the approach may not generalize well to other graphs or query scenarios without further tuning and validation.

These trade-offs and limitations highlight the importance of balancing simplicity with effectiveness and the need for iterative refinement to adapt to different datasets and query patterns.

### Iteration Journey

The iteration process for optimizing the graph involved several stages, starting with a more complex initial approach and evolving into a simpler, more effective solution.

Initially, I developed a highly detailed and complicated solution. This approach involved analyzing the paths taken during successful queries to identify critical transitions between nodes. I tracked the frequency of these transitions and calculated utilities based on these transitions and node importance. The goal was to use this detailed analysis to prioritize connections that would improve the success rate and efficiency of queries. However, this complexity made the implementation harder to manage and sometimes led to suboptimal connections that didn't align perfectly with the actual query patterns.

As I progressed, I realized that a simpler approach could be just as effective. By focusing on nodes with IDs less than 45, which were consistently the most relevant in the query results, I could directly select the primary candidates without the need for detailed frequency analysis. This observation allowed me to streamline the process significantly.

Throughout this iterative process, I learned the importance of balancing simplicity with effectiveness. The initial, more complicated approach provided valuable insights but ultimately proved to be less practical. By simplifying the strategy and focusing on key observations from the results data, I was able to achieve a higher success rate and more efficient query paths. This journey underscored the value of iterative refinement and the need to adapt strategies based on practical observations and constraints.

I also do plan to come back and experiment more with the weights and see if I can make the solution more general while still keeping it practical.
